# rhis-builder-virtual-init
Initialize the bootstrap environment for rhis-builder on a hypervisor platform or hyperscaler

# Coming soon... KVM, VMware, Azure and AWS
We will be using imagebuilder from console.redhat.com to create the images and either download them for hypervisor deployments, or ship them to the appropriate cloud platform and instantiate them.
